1000,Algonquin Provincial Park,#2,Pinetree Lake,45.55,-78.31,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-pinetree-lake-loop/,"I like this site. It’s built on a hill, which means you’re getting your leg workout in if you stay here, but that’s pretty much the only downside. The top of the hill is where the fire pit and tent spots are. There’s room up there for at least a couple of tents, which is good because the rest of the site is on a bit of an angle so ground tents aren’t ideal over most of the area (however, the site is dotted with pine trees that are absolutely perfect if you happen to be using a hammock tent)."
1001,Algonquin Provincial Park,#2,Fork Lake,45.57,-78.35,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-pinetree-lake-loop/,"This is a great island site in the middle of Fork Lake’s southern half. It takes maybe a minute to walk from one end to the other, but it doesn’t feel small or crowded (unless you’re using the thunderbox, which is smack in the middle of the island and has a commanding view of, and can be viewed by, everything. I have to say, that site is a great place to get some serious relaxing done. The swimming is good, there are plenty of trees to hang hammocks from and the setting sun absolutely baked the west side of the island. The temperature differential between the fire pit area, which faces southeast, and the swimming/sunset watching area felt like it was about ten degrees. I was comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt while I was cooking dinner on the site’s western rocks, but I needed long pants, a long shirt and a toque pretty much as soon as I moved over to the fire pit."
1002,Algonquin Provincial Park,#10,Rock Lake,45.49,-78.37,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-pinetree-lake-loop/,"The site is located in Echo Bay, which is in Rock’s southeast corner, just before the Rock Lake dam and the portage over to Galeairy Lake. It’s a decent site. On the plus side, the site feels surprisingly secluded. On the negative side of things, there isn’t a ton of flat ground for tents. The best spot I could see to pitch a tent was directly under a widowmaker factory of a tree. There’s some decent flat ground there, but also a decent chance you’ll be flattened into the ground by a falling branch if you set up there. That said, we still managed to get both our ground tents up. One of them was kind of wedged in between the pines, but it worked.  Given that Rock Lake is an access point lake with cottages, campgrounds and paddle-in sites, you might not expect a whole lot of privacy if you camp there. This site, however, had plenty of it. It’s the only site in Echo Bay and, at least when we were there, the route between Galeairy and Rock didn’t seem too heavily trafficked (granted, we were there on a Friday in mid-September. It’s probably a different story mid-summer)."
1003,Algonquin Provincial Park,,Galeairy Lake,45.49,-78.32,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-rock-clydegale-loop/,"I quite liked this site. Great western exposure for sunset view off of the nice rocky area full of sparse windswept pines and then the firepit area is tucked just inside the trees. The site had a kitchen table (like a proper table!), maybe not really “backcountry-ish” but sure was handy. There was also really good seating around the firepit. Several tent spot options exist. I chose high up on the rocky ledge to enjoy the stars out my tent window. The trail to the thunderbox was easily found, with a pleasant view from the throne. It sort of looked like a trail from the south end of the island was marked to the thunderbox as well, but I don’t think it is shared with the site down there (or maybe it is, but it seemed like it was much closer to the northern site than the site on the bottom of the island)."
1004,Algonquin Provincial Park,,Clydegale Lake,45.43,-78.36,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-rock-clydegale-loop/,"Nice beach landing and two-tiered site. The firepit is elevated, with a nice view south over the lake as well as east and west. Plenty of tent pad options on the lower level by the beach landing. I set up my tent on the west side of the site, overlooking the small island and bay. There is a bit of a shelf/table made from various steel grates/grills between 2 trees and a couple of (very uncomfortable!) bushcraft benches."
1005,Algonquin Provincial Park,,Pen Lake,45.44,-78.37,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-rock-clydegale-loop/,"This site is rather small, with a steep incline (both at the water up to the firepit and behind the site). There are only a couple of tent spots and nothing I’d call flat. Behind the site is a small cliff that at first provided an unwelcome eerie feeling at the site. After climbing up, exploring the top and enjoying the view, I felt better about it though. The thunderbox is marked by a sign and flags on trees, it’s up a hill aways. And at the time of my stay, the thunderbox was brand new (in fact remnants of the old thunderbox were by the firepit, providing a bit of extra firewood!). The site did have a great sunset view."
1006,Haliburton Highlands,#54,Blackcat Lake,45.18,-78.70,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-rock-clydegale-loop/,"Water entry at the point is nice and flat which makes loading and unloading boats easy. Site is on a point which helps keep the bugs away. Two smaller tent pad areas, both with a slight slope. Enough room to string a hammock and setup a secondary shelter. Amazing view of sunrise. Thunderbox is a short walk back in the bush. Firepit on site"
1007,Haliburton Highlands,#62,,45.17,-78.71,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-rock-clydegale-loop/,"it looked quite nice. Exposed peninsula which kept the bugs away. Didn't look particularly large, but had a nice 360 view. Easy boat access. Fire bit present. Did not see signs of a thunderbox, but judging by the site location, it was probably a bit of a walk. Maximum capacity 4 people."
1008,Haliburton Highlands,#31,Red Pine Lake,45.20,-78.71,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-rock-clydegale-loop/,but looked like a nice site with a narrow point swim or fish off of. Maximum capacity 10 people
1009,Haliburton Highlands,#112,Nunikani Lake,45.20,-78.74,https://tripreports.voyageurtripper.com/algonquin-rock-clydegale-loop/,"Very large site that has been over-used. Lots of cut down trees and chainsawed stumps. The mess could have been due to a recent blow down on the site. Plenty of tent pads and space to set a tarp and hammock, but just not the prettiest site. Good launch point for a canoe. Nice surise views. Thunderbox behind site."
